This is a continuous project for codeLouisville.
This is a mock-up of an local artist website and portfolio.

The use of jQuery is for the 'lightbox' effect on the Portfolio page.
The media queries are basically labeled if they are for a practical use. I got a bit carried away.

*The two main photos are supposed to be links to existing pages, I can not seem to figure out why the link is broken.


It's not the prettiest code, but it's my little special baby.
I plan on redoing this soon with the use of Foundations.

Also, cats.
