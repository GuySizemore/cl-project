    <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p class="words">
        I am a self taught Designer / Maker. It has been a long process
         to get to where I am now. It all started about 8 years ago when I
         had an idea for a project that involved the need for a lathe. After
         picking up a cheap one at harbor freight I become hooked with the process.
         Lots of time, in the shop and on Youtube, and lots of cash later I have
         finally reached a point were I can be proud to say, 'I made that.' I am
         always striving to work with new material. That exploration is what drives
         me to make work, while simultaneously making new ideas take a while to get
         off the ground.

         I am twenty-eight years old. I grew up kicking around in the dirt in Oldham
         County, KY. I have always been an outdoors men one way or another,
         constantly playing in the woods, riding bikes, and getting myself into
         all sorts of adventures. I have always been into making something with
         my hands, and its that which drives me most into my endeavor.
