  <p class="title">
    To turn a piece of wood into something useful, in the
    utilitarian sense or to be artistically expressive, is a joyful act.
    When I start a new project it can begin with a simple stroll through the
    neighborhood or a drive on a sunny afternoon. Once I have found a piece
    of wood; an old log in a firewood stack, a freshly fallen tree from that
    spring storm, I can start to make tangible progress on the project at
    hand. I look the piece over and make a decision about what it might
    become. After chainsawing the log into a usable shape I can continue with
    it to the shop. From there it is transformed once again when I mount it
    to the lathe and begin to make roughing cuts. The over all intended shape
    is developed here, but usually the project cannot be completed. For most
    of my work I take the roughed out form and seal it with a special blend
    of wax. It is placed on a shelf, left to be forgotten, until six to eight
    months later when I can get back to work with the now dry form. This long
    process forces me into a kind of patience, giving me time to develop any
    ideas I might have about a particular piece or technique; my style will
    change, my finishing process will change. This existence of change flows
    well with the transformation of the wood itself. After completion, when
    I get to look down at the finished piece in hand, I am thankful that such
    an idea can become a reality through me. The wood that the earth has
    given me, with it's natural beauty, can be captured for a brief moment
    in time, and become a useful object. That feeling of satisfaction is why
    I do what I do. </p>

  <div class="title"> About Me </div>
  <p class="title">
    I am a self taught Designer / Maker. It has been a long process to get to
    where I am now. It all started about 8 years ago when I had an idea for a
    project that involved the need for a lathe. After picking up a cheap one at
    harbor freight I become hooked with the process. Lots of time, in the shop
    and on youtube, and lots of cash later I have finally reached a point were
    I can be proud to say, 'I made that.' I am always striving to work with new
    material. That exploration is what drives me to make work, while
    simultaneously making new ideas take a while to get off the ground.

    I am twenty-eight years old. I grew up kicking around in the dirt in
    Oldham County, KY. I have always been an outdoors men one way or another,
    constantly playing in the woods, riding bikes, and getting myself into all
    sorts of adventures. I have always been into making something with my hands,
    and its that which drives me most into my endeavor.
