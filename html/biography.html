    I am a self taught Designer / Maker. It has been a long process
     to get to where I am now. It all started about 8 years ago when I
     had an idea for a project that involved the need for a lathe. After
     picking up a cheap one at harbor freight I become hooked with the process.
     Lots of time, in the shop and on Youtube, and lots of cash later I have
     finally reached a point were I can be proud to say, 'I made that.' I am
     always striving to work with new material. That exploration is what drives
     me to make work, while simultaneously making new ideas take a while to get
     off the ground.

     I am twenty-eight years old. I grew up kicking around in the dirt in Oldham
     County, KY. I have always been an outdoors men one way or another,
     constantly playing in the woods, riding bikes, and getting myself into
     all sorts of adventures. I have always been into making something with
     my hands, and its that which drives me most into my endeavor.
